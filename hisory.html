    <h3 style="color:darkred;">AngularJS was originally developed in 2009 by Miško Hevery[14] at Brat Tech LLC[15] as the software behind an online JSON storage service, that would have been priced by the megabyte, for easy-to-make applications for the enterprise. This venture
        was located at the web domain "GetAngular.com",[15] and had a few subscribers, before the two decided to abandon the business idea and release Angular as an open-source library. The 1.6 release added many of the concepts of Angular to AngularJS,
        including the concept of a component-based application architecture.[16] This release among others removed the Sandbox, which many developers believed provided additional security, despite numerous vulnerabilities that had been discovered that
        bypassed the sandbox.[17] The current (as of March 2020) stable release of AngularJS is 1.7.9[18] In January 2018, a schedule was announced for phasing-out AngularJS: after releasing 1.7.0, the active development on AngularJS will continue till
        June 30, 2018. Afterwards, 1.7 will be supported till  June 30, 2021 as long-term support.[19]</h3>
