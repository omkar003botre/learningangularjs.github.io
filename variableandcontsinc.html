    <h1>C Variables, Constants and Literals</h1>
    <h2>Variables : In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.<br>To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier).<br> Variable names are just the symbolic representation of a memory location.
        <br>For example: int playerScore = 95;Here, playerScore is a variable of int type.<br> Here, the variable is assigned an integer value 95. The value of a variable can be changed, <br>hence the name variable.char ch = 'a';// some code ch = 'l'.</h2>
    <h2>Constants : If you want to define a variable whose value cannot be changed,<br> you can use the const keyword. This will create a constant.<br> For example, const double PI = 3.14;Notice, we have added keyword const.<br>Here, PI is a symbolic constant;
        its value cannot be changed.
    </h2>
    <h1>Rules for naming a variable</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>A variable name can only have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore.</li>
        <li>he first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore.</li>
        <li>There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the variable name is longer than 31 characters.</li>
    </ol>
