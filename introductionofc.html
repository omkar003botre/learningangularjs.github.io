    <h1 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Introduction Of C Language</h1>
    <h3 style="color: white; ">C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access
        to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development. Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from
        C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).</h3>
